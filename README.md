This script continuously receives tick-by-tick BTC/USDT price data from Binance, computes a simple moving average over the last 5 ticks, and makes trading decisions based on the relationship between the last price and the SMA. It keeps track of the trades, calculates profits, and prints trade details and metrics to the console.
